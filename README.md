# Stellar Age Estimation via Machine Learning

## Abstract

Stellar age, a crucial parameter in understanding stellar and galactic evolution, poses challenges for direct measurement. Traditional methods, such as isochrone fitting, gyrochronology, and asteroseismology, have limitations. This project aims to explore the viability of machine learning, specifically neural networks, for accurate and cost-effective stellar age estimation. Leveraging the GAIA DR3 dataset released in June 2022, we seek to develop a robust model using Tensorflow in Python. Our goal is to identify a set of input parameters that provide precise estimations without the need for resource-intensive data collection. This project was done under the Physics and Astronomy division of the Undergraduate Laboratory at Berkeley.

## Background

Stellar age estimation plays a pivotal role in unraveling the mysteries of cosmic evolution. Classical methods like isochrone fitting rely on theoretical isochrones, while gyrochronology leverages angular velocity and temperature. Asteroseismology studies oscillatory modes but requires extended data collection. These methods have limitations, prompting exploration of machine learning as a potential solution. Recent studies demonstrate the efficacy of neural networks in predicting stellar ages based on observational data.
